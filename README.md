## Project Structure

Documentation is located in [`./docs`](./docs/index.md), this will eventually have a published representation so we can use html-friendly conventions: `index.md` files, relative links etc.

## What's a Virtual Environment (venv)?

A **venv** is an isolated Python environment for this project. It keeps dependencies separate from your system Python and other projects. Think of it as a sandbox.

- **No conflicts**: Different projects can use different package versions
- **No sudo needed**: Install packages without root access
- **Easy cleanup**: Just delete `.venv/` folder

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) for more info on pip vs pipx, troubleshooting, etc.

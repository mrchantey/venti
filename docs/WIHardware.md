# Window Intake Hardware

## Requirements

Note that the requirements are intentionally broad statements. Specifications are the specific numbers and other criteria that flow from these requirements.

### Essential

* Provide controlled ventilation to
  * keep the CO2 levels at a healthy level for the way in which the rooms containing the intakes are used
  * limit the energy cost of maintaining a comfortable temperature in the home
* Filter the incoming air to minimize pollen
* The noise level must be acceptable
* The form factor must be sufficiently unobtrusive
* Cost of operation must be worth the benefit
  * Filters
  * Energy
* Cost of the build must be acceptable (the hobby aspect ameliorates this a little)
* The windows security must not be compromised too much (the rooms we are targeting are upstairs and so access by thieves is not as serious as a ground floor window)

### Desirable

* Filter pollutants. Air quality sensors in our location report healthy air almost all the time but an added bonus would be to filter particles from nearby major roads and bush fires
* Assist in managing the temperature and as a stretch goal, humidity in the home
* Sound isolation from the outside. Most of the time this is not an issue but for several hours on about two days a week we have a "mow and blow" gardening. We usually close our windows but the these intakes are semi-permanent installations
* Amenable to automation

## Concept Development

A leading challenge for this system is keeping the fan noise tolerable whilst providing sufficient ventilation. Informed by DIY air purifiers, a practical solution is to use multiple computer case fans. We can expect these to be readily available for many years and provide reasonable noise to flow-rate performance at a moderate cost. Pulse width modulation (PWM) fans also have speed control that prevents stalling at slow speeds with readily available control electronics. PWM is also moderately amenable to automation.

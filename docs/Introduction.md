# Introduction

This project's aim is to use the automation of DIY positive ventilation units Doug uses in his home to explore the application of a system Pete is working on called Beetmash.

## Why Window Intakes? Doug's Story

I have had  sinus issues for many years and one of the issues that I thought worth addressing was indoor air quality. In order to investigate whether this might be an issue for my home, I obtained an air quality monitor, the AirGradient One Model I-9PSL ([Indoor Air Quality Monitor](https://www.airgradient.com/indoor/)). This monitors CO2, NOx, TVOCs, particulate matter at 1, 2.5 and 10 microns, temperature and humidity.

I thought the particulate matter would be the most interesting measure but noticed our CO2 would rapidly get higher than recommended. I could managing the CO2 level with opening windows but during hot or cold weather it was hard to get just the right amount of fresh air without wasting energy. Then came a spring and a severe reaction to pollen.

I looked at the commercial solutions positive input ventilation (PIV) and heat or energy recovery ventilation (ERV and HRV) systems. These were technically feasible but very expensive. They also tended to be whole house solutions and less amenable to providing ventilation targeting our actual occupation patterns.

Inspired by DIY air purifiers, I tackled a DIY mechanical ventilation solution that fits in the window. It is very much like an air purifier on the wall and in fact one of the units is a slightly modified air purifier bolted to a sheet of plywood.

## A Note on the Tools Used Here

### Markdown

We have chosen to use a markdown and the documentation format because

* it has no the tie-in with proprietary systems
* version control is easy being text based
* basic linking of files works - at least in vscode (ctrl-click) and probably many other markdown editors
* it is very popular and unlikely to be superseded or drop out of favour
* publishing is relatively easy (Doug thinks Pandoc woud get the job done but hasn't explored it yet)

### GitHub

* Git - because it is very popular and stable and well established
* GutHub - they are nice enough to provide free accounts for now. Moving to another host should be quite easy as long as we don't rely on too many or any GitHub specific features

### Discord

* Readily accessible and in use for Beetmash
* We will treat the discussion as ephemeral. Consequential information must be recorded in this documentation system.
